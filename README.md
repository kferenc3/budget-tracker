## Description

As of now the tool is a work in progress. I have been testing locally with my own finances for a month now. My aim is to test for an additional 1 or 2 months and cover at least 80% of the code with tests. The next step will be to build in automatic schema management and cloud deployment. 

The code itself is in need for some simplification and cleanup, but that is ongoing as I test the functionalities.
